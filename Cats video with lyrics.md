# Cats video with lyrics

First source the cats video. We are downloading it on baidu ai from baidu netdisk.
Can you parse the download link directly?

found script from greasyfork.

why the download speed is low? why there is only one connection? shall i use thunder?

the thunder can be invoked, may you test it here.

so i agree all i need is some sort of communication, across these devices.
