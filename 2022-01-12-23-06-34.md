Cannot staying here forever coding shit. The issue is that we are too absorbed to seek for challenge, forgetting the way back, forgetting how we get this far.
Cyberspace is exciting, but human does not evolve inside chips. In order to get things back on track, you need to forget about everything artificial.
No matter how smart you are, creating a place  needless to  move at all is dangerous and not possible. You must know when to leave and what to do without seeing code at all.
