# MMDetection/MMD

if we can re-trace the action/expression done by vtubers, we can monetize those "highlight cuts".

found occasionally when browsing MMD, but found this with so many stars, which is an instance detection/segmentation library.
https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection

while rendering mmd can be done with mmd viewer like https://github.com/benikabocha/saba or could use renderer like blender or unity. we must bake physics before dancing.

found other dedicated renderer for mmd, with bullet physics:
https://github.com/jinfagang/mmc

found interesting repo of poetry composing:
https://github.com/jinfagang/tensorflow_poems

mediapipe/paddlevideo alike:
