# MMDetection/MMD

found occasionally when browsing MMD, but found this with so many stars, which is an instance detection/segmentation library.
https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection

while rendering mmd can be done with mmd viewer like https://github.com/benikabocha/saba or could use renderer like blender or unity. we must bake physics before dancing.

found other dedicated renderer for mmd:
