# Python Media Automation

we first see the world, get the observation and respond in the form of content. it is a feedback loop.

breakdown approach:
granualize every step, showing all possibilities to get content created and then optimoze it using standards.

filter approach:
establish some topics, create topic specific approaches to arrange the content, choose the best among all topics.

are they compatible? are you sure it is modular, scalable and extensible?

for novices, they have few unpolished ideas and waiting to realize it using code. but it lacks the feedback loop and thus you are unable to change yourself according to the reaction. breakdown approach must be used to automate the optimization, and topic based approach is simple at first hand.
