# Python Media Automation

we first see the world, get the observation and respond in the form of content. it is a feedback loop.

breakdown approach:
granualize every step, showing all possibilities to get content created and then optimoze it using standards.

filter approach:
establish some topics, create topic specific approaches to arrange the content, choose the best among all topics.

are they compatible? are you sure it is modular, scalable and extensible?

for novices, they have few unpolished ideas and waiting to realize it using code. but it lacks the feedback loop and thus you are unable to change yourself according to the reaction. breakdown approach must be used to automate the optimization, and topic based approach is simple at first hand.

to avoid copyright issues search for google.

topic based approach assues the public always have something in common and thus you only search specific things at first hand. they are easy to control, static and consistent. breakdown approach is where the evolution begins.

let's assume our topic is about pets on weibo. pets have different kinds and the content creaters are different from each other. all we do is to download and upload. we get descriptions from our viewers, video play counts and various feedback. we improve the source by our feedback, searching for more untouched contents and more mixes like video/audio crossing.

breakdown approach is demostrated first-hand with our actor-critic model. we first view all possible posts from all sources, find what's interesting and repost it to our target platform. this is likely to be cheating. we again choose our sources, our approach of modification based on feedback. topics are generated from the very first step.

the model of interests, which generates the topic, is the key breakdown approach.
