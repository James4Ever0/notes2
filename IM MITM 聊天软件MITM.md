# IM MITM 聊天软件 MITM

better do this in virtual enviorment without using any real world platform, just your own IM enviorment like a self-hosted IRC or something.

is there any existing solution like telegram-mitm or twitter mitm?

topic analysis among recent frequent conversations

procedures:
1.add two friends (active) and bridge them
2.intercept them, filter insecure data like screenshots, identities and explicit contents, and analyze needs (probably with your generated response)?
3.send intentional Ads and fix the conversation in three sentences.
